Working with Databases is important.

Let's get back to multi tier software architecutre:
- UI
- Service
- Storage

When we test on some level usually we need this level and previous level.
For exaple:
Testing UI usually require accessing UI + Service layers.
Testing Service usually require accessing Service + Storage layers.

SOAP UI can work with following database:
MySql
PostgreSQL
IBMDB2

1. Create new SOAP Project form templates

It will create project for this service:
http://wsf.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/Weather.asmx?WSDL

2. Jmeter 3.0.0 depricates testing of SOAP/XML-RPC Request Step

Most likely you don't need it because it is not exactly SOAP.
Suggested way to test SOAP Services is with HTTP Request steps.

If you want to test soap you add HTTP Requests and manually enter the content.
You can use WSDL Browser or SOAP UI + Fiddler to se what is the actual request
and then try to recreate it in Jmeter.

It is really painful:)
